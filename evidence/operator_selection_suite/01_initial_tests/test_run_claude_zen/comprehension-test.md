# OCTAVE Operator Comprehension Test

## Test Methodology
We'll present operator examples to different AI models WITHOUT context and ask them to interpret the relationships. This tests how intuitive and universally understandable each approach is.

## Test Prompts

### Prompt 1: Basic Interpretation
"What does this expression mean? Explain the relationship between the components:
[OPERATOR_EXAMPLE]"

### Prompt 2: Flow Understanding
"Describe the process flow represented by this notation:
[OPERATOR_EXAMPLE]"

### Prompt 3: Relationship Analysis
"What type of relationship exists between the first two components, and how does the third component affect them?
[OPERATOR_EXAMPLE]"

## Test Examples (One from each scenario)

### Example 1 (Microservices)
- Unicode: `User_Service ⊕ Auth_Service ⚡ Rate_Limiter → Checkout_Flow`
- ASCII Math: `User_Service + Auth_Service * Rate_Limiter -> Checkout_Flow`
- ASCII Text: `User_Service _AND_ Auth_Service _VS_ Rate_Limiter _TO_ Checkout_Flow`
- Natural: `User_Service WITH Auth_Service VERSUS Rate_Limiter LEADS_TO Checkout_Flow`

### Example 2 (Database)
- Unicode: `Raw_Data ⊕ Schema_Validation ⚡ Data_Quality_Rules → Clean_Data`
- ASCII Math: `Raw_Data + Schema_Validation * Data_Quality_Rules -> Clean_Data`
- ASCII Text: `Raw_Data _AND_ Schema_Validation _VS_ Data_Quality_Rules _TO_ Clean_Data`
- Natural: `Raw_Data WITH Schema_Validation VERSUS Data_Quality_Rules LEADS_TO Clean_Data`

### Example 3 (CI/CD)
- Unicode: `Code_Commit ⊕ Unit_Tests ⚡ Coverage_Threshold → Build_Artifact`
- ASCII Math: `Code_Commit + Unit_Tests * Coverage_Threshold -> Build_Artifact`
- ASCII Text: `Code_Commit _AND_ Unit_Tests _VS_ Coverage_Threshold _TO_ Build_Artifact`
- Natural: `Code_Commit WITH Unit_Tests VERSUS Coverage_Threshold LEADS_TO Build_Artifact`

### Example 4 (API)
- Unicode: `HTTP_Request ⊕ JWT_Validation ⚡ Token_Expiry → Authenticated_Request`
- ASCII Math: `HTTP_Request + JWT_Validation * Token_Expiry -> Authenticated_Request`
- ASCII Text: `HTTP_Request _AND_ JWT_Validation _VS_ Token_Expiry _TO_ Authenticated_Request`
- Natural: `HTTP_Request WITH JWT_Validation VERSUS Token_Expiry LEADS_TO Authenticated_Request`

### Example 5 (Reliability)
- Unicode: `Primary_Node ⊕ Secondary_Node ⚡ Split_Brain_Risk → Active_Cluster`
- ASCII Math: `Primary_Node + Secondary_Node * Split_Brain_Risk -> Active_Cluster`
- ASCII Text: `Primary_Node _AND_ Secondary_Node _VS_ Split_Brain_Risk _TO_ Active_Cluster`
- Natural: `Primary_Node WITH Secondary_Node VERSUS Split_Brain_Risk LEADS_TO Active_Cluster`

## Scoring Criteria

### Interpretation Accuracy (1-10)
- 10: Perfect understanding of all relationships
- 8-9: Correct core understanding with minor gaps
- 6-7: Generally correct but misses nuances
- 4-5: Partially correct, significant misunderstandings
- 1-3: Mostly incorrect interpretation

### Key Elements to Check
1. **Synthesis/Combination**: Do they understand the joining/merging aspect?
2. **Tension/Opposition**: Do they recognize the constraining/opposing force?
3. **Progress/Flow**: Do they see the directional outcome?
4. **Overall Meaning**: Do they grasp the complete relationship?
