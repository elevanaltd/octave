# README: Claude Code (Zen MCP) Test Run

This directory contains the results from the OCTAVE Operator Test Suite as executed by Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, guided by the `zen-mcp` system prompt.

## Summary

This test run provides a deep and nuanced analysis, with a particular focus on the fatal flaws of certain operator styles when exposed to real-world edge cases.

Like the other tests, it concludes that the initial Unicode and ASCII Math operators are unsuitable for production use. It goes a step further by proposing a set of **modified, more expressive ASCII Text operators** (e.g., `+WITH+`, `+CONSTRAINEDBY+`) to avoid any potential conflict with boolean `AND` and to enhance clarity.
