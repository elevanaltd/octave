# Phase 5: Edge Case Testing Results

## Test Methodology
- Tested ambiguous contexts (mathematical expressions, boolean logic)
- Verified behavior with undefined operators
- Checked consistency across different document types
- Evaluated nested and complex expressions

## Edge Case Scenarios

### 1. Mathematical Context Confusion

#### Test Case: Calculation vs System Flow
```
Example: "Calculate total load then distribute to servers"

A) Total_Load = Users * 100 ⊕ Cache_Hit_Rate ⚡ Miss_Penalty → Server_Pool
B) Total_Load = Users * 100 + Cache_Hit_Rate * Miss_Penalty -> Server_Pool  
C) Total_Load = Users * 100 _AND_ Cache_Hit_Rate _VS_ Miss_Penalty _TO_ Server_Pool
D) Total_Load = Users * 100 WITH Cache_Hit_Rate VERSUS Miss_Penalty LEADS_TO Server_Pool
```

**Interpretation Issues:**
- Unicode: Is ⊕ XOR or addition? Is ⚡ multiplication or conflict? (Ambiguity: 9/10)
- ASCII Math: Clearly mathematical, but is + addition or combination? (Ambiguity: 7/10)
- ASCII Text: Clear separation of math from flow operators (Ambiguity: 2/10)
- Natural Language: Clear intent, no mathematical confusion (Ambiguity: 1/10)

### 2. Boolean Logic Expressions

#### Test Case: Conditional System Behavior
```
Example: "If auth AND session valid OR admin override, proceed"

A) (Auth_Valid ⊕ Session_Valid) ⚡ Admin_Override → Access_Granted
B) (Auth_Valid + Session_Valid) * Admin_Override -> Access_Granted
C) (Auth_Valid _AND_ Session_Valid) _VS_ Admin_Override _TO_ Access_Granted
D) (Auth_Valid WITH Session_Valid) VERSUS Admin_Override LEADS_TO Access_Granted
```

**Interpretation Issues:**
- Unicode: ⊕ could be XOR, not AND! Critical logic error (Correctness: 3/10)
- ASCII Math: + might mean OR in boolean context (Correctness: 5/10)
- ASCII Text: _AND_ is unambiguous, but _VS_ for OR is odd (Correctness: 7/10)
- Natural Language: WITH isn't clearly AND, VERSUS isn't OR (Correctness: 6/10)

### 3. Nested Complex Expressions

#### Test Case: Multi-level System Architecture
```
A) [[A ⊕ B] ⚡ [C → D ⊕ E]] → [F ⚡ [G ⊕ H → I]]
B) [[A + B] * [C -> D + E]] -> [F * [G + H -> I]]
C) [[A _AND_ B] _VS_ [C _TO_ D _AND_ E]] _TO_ [F _VS_ [G _AND_ H _TO_ I]]
D) [[A WITH B] VERSUS [C LEADS_TO D WITH E]] LEADS_TO [F VERSUS [G WITH H LEADS_TO I]]
```

**Readability at 3+ Levels:**
- Unicode: Nearly unreadable, operator soup (Score: 2/10)
- ASCII Math: Parseable but requires careful reading (Score: 5/10)
- ASCII Text: Verbose but trackable (Score: 7/10)
- Natural Language: Very verbose but clear (Score: 6/10)

### 4. Operator Precedence Ambiguity

#### Test Case: Order of Operations
```
A) A ⊕ B ⚡ C → D ⊕ E    # What evaluates first?
B) A + B * C -> D + E     # Mathematical precedence?
C) A _AND_ B _VS_ C _TO_ D _AND_ E    # Left to right?
D) A WITH B VERSUS C LEADS_TO D WITH E # Sequential?
```

**Precedence Clarity:**
- Unicode: No established precedence rules (Clarity: 2/10)
- ASCII Math: Follows math precedence, confusing for flow (Clarity: 4/10)
- ASCII Text: No precedence needed, reads sequentially (Clarity: 9/10)
- Natural Language: Natural reading order (Clarity: 10/10)

### 5. Mixed Domain Expressions

#### Test Case: Combining Different Concepts
```
Example: "Memory usage at 80% triggers scaling with 2x multiplier against cost constraints"

A) Memory[80%] ⚡ Scale_Trigger ⊕ Multiplier[2x] ⚡ Cost_Limit → Action
B) Memory[80%] * Scale_Trigger + Multiplier[2x] * Cost_Limit -> Action
C) Memory[80%] _VS_ Scale_Trigger _AND_ Multiplier[2x] _VS_ Cost_Limit _TO_ Action
D) Memory[80%] VERSUS Scale_Trigger WITH Multiplier[2x] VERSUS Cost_Limit LEADS_TO Action
```

**Domain Mixing Handling:**
- Unicode: Operators meaningless with percentages (Score: 3/10)
- ASCII Math: Confusion with numeric values (Score: 4/10)
- ASCII Text: Clear separation of concepts (Score: 8/10)
- Natural Language: Natural handling of mixed domains (Score: 9/10)

### 6. Error Recovery and Typos

#### Test Case: Common Typing Errors
```
What happens with typos?

A) User ⊗ Auth → Result  (Wrong Unicode symbol)
B) User -< Auth + Result  (Typo in arrow)
C) User _AN_ Auth _TO_ Result  (Missing D)
D) User WIT Auth LEADS_TO Result  (Missing H)
```

**Error Recognition:**
- Unicode: Wrong symbol = completely different meaning (Recovery: 1/10)
- ASCII Math: Syntax error, easy to spot (Recovery: 7/10)
- ASCII Text: Obvious typo, meaning preserved (Recovery: 8/10)
- Natural Language: Still readable despite typo (Recovery: 9/10)

### 7. Internationalization

#### Test Case: Non-English Entity Names
```
A) 用户请求 → 认证服务 ⊕ 会话管理 ⚡ 限流器 → 购物车
B) 用户请求 -> 认证服务 + 会话管理 * 限流器 -> 购物车
C) 用户请求 _TO_ 认证服务 _AND_ 会话管理 _VS_ 限流器 _TO_ 购物车
D) 用户请求 LEADS_TO 认证服务 WITH 会话管理 VERSUS 限流器 LEADS_TO 购物车
```

**International Compatibility:**
- Unicode: Symbols work universally (Score: 8/10)
- ASCII Math: Universal operators (Score: 9/10)
- ASCII Text: English operators may confuse (Score: 5/10)
- Natural Language: English-centric (Score: 4/10)

### 8. Version Control Conflicts

#### Test Case: Merge Conflict Resolution
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
A) Service_A ⊕ Service_B ⚡ Limiter → Output
=======
A) Service_A ⊕ Service_C ⚡ Limiter → Output
>>>>>>> feature
```

**Merge Conflict Clarity:**
- Unicode: Hard to spot symbol differences (Score: 3/10)
- ASCII Math: Clear operator differences (Score: 8/10)
- ASCII Text: Very clear semantic differences (Score: 9/10)
- Natural Language: Most readable in conflicts (Score: 10/10)

## Critical Findings

1. **Unicode operators fail catastrophically in edge cases** - Especially dangerous in boolean logic
2. **ASCII Math operators create ambiguity** - Math vs system flow confusion
3. **ASCII Text handles edge cases well** - Clear separation of concerns
4. **Natural Language is most robust** - Handles edge cases naturally

## Conclusion
Edge case testing reveals that Natural Language and ASCII Text operators are significantly more robust and safer for production use, while Unicode operators pose serious risks in ambiguous contexts.
