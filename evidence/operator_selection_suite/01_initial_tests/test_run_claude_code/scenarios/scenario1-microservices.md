# Scenario 1: Microservices Architecture
## Context: E-commerce System with Authentication, Payment, and Inventory Services

### Real-World Example: Checkout Process Flow

#### A) Unicode Operators (Current OCTAVE)
```
User_Request → Auth_Service ⊕ Session_Manager ⚡ Rate_Limiter → Cart_Service
Cart_Service ⊕ Inventory_Service → Stock_Validation ⚡ Reserved_Items → Payment_Gateway
Payment_Gateway ⊕ Fraud_Detection ⚡ Risk_Score → Transaction_Processor
Transaction_Processor → Order_Service ⊕ Notification_Service → User_Confirmation
```

#### B) ASCII Math Operators
```
User_Request -> Auth_Service + Session_Manager * Rate_Limiter -> Cart_Service
Cart_Service + Inventory_Service -> Stock_Validation * Reserved_Items -> Payment_Gateway
Payment_Gateway + Fraud_Detection * Risk_Score -> Transaction_Processor
Transaction_Processor -> Order_Service + Notification_Service -> User_Confirmation
```

#### C) ASCII Text Operators
```
User_Request _TO_ Auth_Service _AND_ Session_Manager _VS_ Rate_Limiter _TO_ Cart_Service
Cart_Service _AND_ Inventory_Service _TO_ Stock_Validation _VS_ Reserved_Items _TO_ Payment_Gateway
Payment_Gateway _AND_ Fraud_Detection _VS_ Risk_Score _TO_ Transaction_Processor
Transaction_Processor _TO_ Order_Service _AND_ Notification_Service _TO_ User_Confirmation
```

#### D) Natural Language
```
User_Request LEADS_TO Auth_Service WITH Session_Manager VERSUS Rate_Limiter LEADS_TO Cart_Service
Cart_Service WITH Inventory_Service LEADS_TO Stock_Validation VERSUS Reserved_Items LEADS_TO Payment_Gateway
Payment_Gateway WITH Fraud_Detection VERSUS Risk_Score LEADS_TO Transaction_Processor
Transaction_Processor LEADS_TO Order_Service WITH Notification_Service LEADS_TO User_Confirmation
```

### Complex Service Interaction Pattern

#### A) Unicode Operators
```
[API_Gateway ⊕ Load_Balancer] → {
  Auth_Service ⚡ Token_Validator → Session_Store
  ⊕
  Request_Router → Service_Mesh
} ⚡ Circuit_Breaker → Backend_Services

Backend_Services = {
  User_Service ⊕ Profile_Cache
  ⚡
  Order_Service ⊕ Transaction_Log
  →
  Analytics_Pipeline
}
```

#### B) ASCII Math Operators
```
[API_Gateway + Load_Balancer] -> {
  Auth_Service * Token_Validator -> Session_Store
  +
  Request_Router -> Service_Mesh
} * Circuit_Breaker -> Backend_Services

Backend_Services = {
  User_Service + Profile_Cache
  *
  Order_Service + Transaction_Log
  ->
  Analytics_Pipeline
}
```

#### C) ASCII Text Operators
```
[API_Gateway _AND_ Load_Balancer] _TO_ {
  Auth_Service _VS_ Token_Validator _TO_ Session_Store
  _AND_
  Request_Router _TO_ Service_Mesh
} _VS_ Circuit_Breaker _TO_ Backend_Services

Backend_Services = {
  User_Service _AND_ Profile_Cache
  _VS_
  Order_Service _AND_ Transaction_Log
  _TO_
  Analytics_Pipeline
}
```

#### D) Natural Language
```
[API_Gateway WITH Load_Balancer] LEADS_TO {
  Auth_Service VERSUS Token_Validator LEADS_TO Session_Store
  WITH
  Request_Router LEADS_TO Service_Mesh
} VERSUS Circuit_Breaker LEADS_TO Backend_Services

Backend_Services = {
  User_Service WITH Profile_Cache
  VERSUS
  Order_Service WITH Transaction_Log
  LEADS_TO
  Analytics_Pipeline
}
```
