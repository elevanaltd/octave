# Scenario 3: CI/CD Pipeline
## Context: Automated Deployment with Testing, Security Scanning, and Rollback

### Real-World Example: Multi-Stage Deployment Pipeline

#### A) Unicode Operators (Current OCTAVE)
```
Git_Push → CI_Trigger ⊕ Branch_Rules ⚡ Protected_Branches → Build_Stage
Build_Stage → Unit_Tests ⊕ Integration_Tests ⚡ Test_Failures → Quality_Gate
Quality_Gate ⊕ Security_Scan → Vulnerability_Check ⚡ Critical_Issues → Staging_Deploy
Staging_Deploy → E2E_Tests ⊕ Performance_Tests ⚡ SLA_Violations → Production_Gate
Production_Gate ⊕ Approval_Workflow → Blue_Green_Deploy ⚡ Rollback_Trigger → Live_System
```

#### B) ASCII Math Operators
```
Git_Push -> CI_Trigger + Branch_Rules * Protected_Branches -> Build_Stage
Build_Stage -> Unit_Tests + Integration_Tests * Test_Failures -> Quality_Gate
Quality_Gate + Security_Scan -> Vulnerability_Check * Critical_Issues -> Staging_Deploy
Staging_Deploy -> E2E_Tests + Performance_Tests * SLA_Violations -> Production_Gate
Production_Gate + Approval_Workflow -> Blue_Green_Deploy * Rollback_Trigger -> Live_System
```

#### C) ASCII Text Operators
```
Git_Push _TO_ CI_Trigger _AND_ Branch_Rules _VS_ Protected_Branches _TO_ Build_Stage
Build_Stage _TO_ Unit_Tests _AND_ Integration_Tests _VS_ Test_Failures _TO_ Quality_Gate
Quality_Gate _AND_ Security_Scan _TO_ Vulnerability_Check _VS_ Critical_Issues _TO_ Staging_Deploy
Staging_Deploy _TO_ E2E_Tests _AND_ Performance_Tests _VS_ SLA_Violations _TO_ Production_Gate
Production_Gate _AND_ Approval_Workflow _TO_ Blue_Green_Deploy _VS_ Rollback_Trigger _TO_ Live_System
```

#### D) Natural Language
```
Git_Push LEADS_TO CI_Trigger WITH Branch_Rules VERSUS Protected_Branches LEADS_TO Build_Stage
Build_Stage LEADS_TO Unit_Tests WITH Integration_Tests VERSUS Test_Failures LEADS_TO Quality_Gate
Quality_Gate WITH Security_Scan LEADS_TO Vulnerability_Check VERSUS Critical_Issues LEADS_TO Staging_Deploy
Staging_Deploy LEADS_TO E2E_Tests WITH Performance_Tests VERSUS SLA_Violations LEADS_TO Production_Gate
Production_Gate WITH Approval_Workflow LEADS_TO Blue_Green_Deploy VERSUS Rollback_Trigger LEADS_TO Live_System
```

### Complex Pipeline with Parallel Stages and Conditional Flows

#### A) Unicode Operators
```
Source_Code → {
  Linting ⊕ Code_Format
  ⚡ Style_Violations
  ‖
  Dependency_Check ⊕ License_Scan
  ⚡ GPL_Conflicts
  ‖
  SAST_Scan ⊕ Secret_Detection
  ⚡ Security_Blocks
} → Build_Artifacts

Build_Artifacts ⊕ Container_Registry → {
  Dev_Environment → Smoke_Tests
  ⚡ Fast_Feedback
  ‖
  QA_Environment → Full_Test_Suite ⊕ Load_Tests
  ⚡ Performance_Regression
} → Release_Candidate

Release_Candidate ⊕ Change_Management ⚡ Freeze_Windows → {
  Canary_Deploy[5%] → Metrics_Analysis ⚡ Error_Rate_Spike → {
    Success: Progressive_Rollout[25% → 50% → 100%]
    ⚡
    Failure: Instant_Rollback ⊕ Incident_Alert
  }
}
```

#### B) ASCII Math Operators
```
Source_Code -> {
  Linting + Code_Format
  * Style_Violations
  ||
  Dependency_Check + License_Scan
  * GPL_Conflicts
  ||
  SAST_Scan + Secret_Detection
  * Security_Blocks
} -> Build_Artifacts

Build_Artifacts + Container_Registry -> {
  Dev_Environment -> Smoke_Tests
  * Fast_Feedback
  ||
  QA_Environment -> Full_Test_Suite + Load_Tests
  * Performance_Regression
} -> Release_Candidate

Release_Candidate + Change_Management * Freeze_Windows -> {
  Canary_Deploy[5%] -> Metrics_Analysis * Error_Rate_Spike -> {
    Success: Progressive_Rollout[25% -> 50% -> 100%]
    *
    Failure: Instant_Rollback + Incident_Alert
  }
}
```

#### C) ASCII Text Operators
```
