# README: ChatGPT-4 Test Run

This directory contains the results from the OCTAVE Operator Test Suite as executed by OpenAI's ChatGPT-4.

## Summary

This analysis represents a more direct, first-principles evaluation of the four operator styles. While less exhaustive in its generated documentation than the other model runs, it arrives at the same core conclusions with high confidence.

The test effectively validates the impracticality of Unicode and the ambiguity of ASCII Math, ultimately recommending ASCII Text as the most balanced and practical solution for real-world development and documentation.
