### Scenario 5: System Reliability
**Context:** High-availability system with redundancy, monitoring, and failover
**Document:** Reliability patterns and trade-off management

**A) Unicode Operators**
`Primary ⊕ Replica ⚡ Monitoring → Failover ⚡ Recovery`

**B) ASCII Math Operators**
`Primary + Replica * Monitoring -> Failover * Recovery`

**C) ASCII Text Operators**n`Primary _AND_ Replica _VS_ Monitoring _TO_ Failover _VS_ Recovery`

**D) Natural Language**
`Primary WITH Replica VERSUS Monitoring LEADS_TO Failover VERSUS Recovery`
