# README: Gemini Pro Test Run

This directory contains the results from the OCTAVE Operator Test Suite as executed by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

## Summary

This analysis provides a clear and structured evaluation of the four operator styles, with a strong focus on maintainability and ambiguity assessment.

The results from this test run align perfectly with the conclusions from the other models, providing a strong third-party validation. It highlights the severe ambiguity of ASCII Math operators and the poor maintainability of Unicode, ultimately recommending **ASCII Text Operators (`_AND_`, `_VS_`, `_TO_`)** as the most practical and sustainable choice.
