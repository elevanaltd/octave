**You are a world-class principal engineer and language designer. Your task is to design the optimal core operator *set* for a new Domain-Specific Language (DSL) called OCTAVE.**

**Context:**
OCTAVE is a DSL designed primarily for LLM-to-LLM communication. Its goals are to be machine-readable, human-debuggable, token-efficient, and semantically rich.

**The Problem:**
We need to define a standard, cohesive family of three core operators to represent the fundamental relationships in a system:

1.  **Synthesis:** A and B are combined or work together.
2.  **Tension:** A is in opposition to or constrained by B.
3.  **Progress:** A leads to or flows to B.

**Our Empirical Findings (Hard Constraints):**
Our comprehensive, multi-model testing has revealed several hard constraints that any proposed solution *must* respect:
1.  **NO UNICODE SYMBOLS:** Operators like `⊕`, `→`, or `⚡` are forbidden. They fail catastrophically in real-world tooling (`grep`, `diff`), are difficult to type, and have accessibility issues.
2.  **NO AMBIGUOUS ASCII MATH SYMBOLS:** Single-character operators like `+` or `*` are forbidden. They create unacceptable, critical ambiguity in technical documentation that might also contain mathematical or boolean expressions.
3.  **NO PURE NATURAL LANGUAGE:** Operators like `WITH` or `VERSUS` used as plain words are forbidden. They are too verbose for complex expressions and are difficult for a parser to reliably distinguish from regular text content.

**The Unbreakable Design Principles (Your Goal):**
The optimal operator *family* you design must satisfy these principles, in order of importance:
1.  **Unambiguity:** Each operator must have no common alternative meaning in a technical context. The family must be uniquely identifiable as belonging to OCTAVE.
2.  **Zero-Shot LLM Comprehension:** The operators must be instantly and correctly understood by a wide range of LLMs without special fine-tuning.
3.  **Cohesion & Consistency:** The operators should feel like they belong together. The design of one should inform the others.
4.  **Toolchain Robustness:** The entire set must work perfectly with standard developer tools (`grep`, `git diff`, IDEs).
5.  **Human Readability & Low Cognitive Load:** The operators should be easy for a developer to read, understand, and type.

**Your Task:**
1.  **Brainstorm and Generate Novel, Cohesive Families:** From first principles, generate a list of 2-3 novel, *cohesive families* of operators (each family containing a solution for Synthesis, Tension, and Progress). Think holistically about how the operators in each family relate to one another.
2.  **Rigorously Evaluate Each Family:** For each *family* you generate, create a small evaluation matrix. Analyze the family as a whole against our 5 design principles. Showcase how the operators look and feel together in a realistic example like `SERVICE_A [synthesis] SERVICE_B [tension] RATE_LIMITER [progress] RESULT`.
3.  **Provide a Final, Justified Recommendation:** Based on your analysis, declare one of your generated *families* as the optimal solution. Provide the complete, recommended set of three operators and write a concise, final justification explaining *why* this specific family represents the best possible design compromise for the long-term health and success of the OCTAVE specification.
