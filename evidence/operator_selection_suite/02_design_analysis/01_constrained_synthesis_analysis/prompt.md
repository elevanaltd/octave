**You are a principal engineer and language designer tasked with making the final decision on the core "synthesis" operator for a new Domain-Specific Language (DSL) called OCTAVE.**

**Context:**
OCTAVE is a DSL designed for LLM-to-LLM communication. Its primary goals are to be machine-readable, human-debuggable, token-efficient, and semantically rich. It is used in system prompts, agent-to-agent messaging, and structured documentation.

**The Journey So Far (Our Empirical Evidence):**
We have conducted a comprehensive, multi-model test suite to find the best operators. Our tests conclusively proved the following:
1.  **Unicode Operators (e.g., `âŠ•`)**: FAILED. While token-efficient, they are impractical due to poor tooling support (grep/diff), accessibility issues, and typing difficulty.
2.  **ASCII Math Operators (e.g., `+`, `*`)**: FAILED. They are fatally ambiguous when used in documentation that might also contain mathematical or boolean expressions.
3.  **Natural Language Operators (e.g., `WITH`)**: FAILED. They are too verbose and become unreadable and hard to parse in complex, nested expressions.

**The Core Dilemma: The Final Two Candidates**
Our extensive testing has led us to a final decision between two ASCII-based approaches for the "synthesis" or "combination" operator:

1.  **`_AND_`**:
    *   **Pros:** Extremely intuitive for both humans and LLMs (leverages the deeply embedded meaning of "and"). Achieved the highest consensus across our test models. Clean syntax.
    *   **Cons:** Has a rare but potential ambiguity. In documentation for systems that use boolean logic (e.g., SQL), it could be visually confused with the `AND` keyword.

2.  **`+WITH+`** (or a similar variant like `++`):
    *   **Pros:** Completely unambiguous. The surrounding `+` characters signal it's a special operator, removing any chance of a clash with keywords.
    *   **Cons:** Less intuitive than `_AND_`. The word "with" can sometimes imply accompaniment rather than a true synthesis. The syntax is slightly noisier.

**Our Unbreakable Design Principles:**
The final operator *must* satisfy these criteria, in order of importance:
1.  **Unambiguity:** It must not have a common alternative meaning in a technical context.
2.  **Zero-Shot LLM Comprehension:** It must be instantly understood by a wide range of LLMs without special fine-tuning or complex explanations.
3.  **Toolchain Robustness:** It must work perfectly with standard developer tools like `grep`, `git diff`, IDEs, and linters.
4.  **Human Readability & Low Cognitive Load:** It should be easy for a developer to read and understand with minimal effort.
5.  **Consistency & Extensibility:** It must fit into a cohesive system of operators and be easy to build upon.

**Your Task:**
Given all of this context, perform a final, definitive analysis.
1.  **Analyze the Trade-offs:** Rigorously evaluate `_AND_` vs. `+WITH+` against the design principles. Acknowledge the pros and cons of each in depth.
2.  **Generate Novel Alternatives (if any exist):** Based on your understanding of language, compilers, and LLMs, is there a third, superior alternative we have not considered that better satisfies all principles?
3.  **Provide a Final, Justified Recommendation:** State your final choice. Defend it with first-principles reasoning, using our empirical evidence and design principles. Explain *why* your recommended choice represents the optimal engineering compromise for the long-term health and success of the OCTAVE specification.
