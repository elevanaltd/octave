# Evidence: OCTAVE Operator Selection Suite

This directory contains the complete, multi-stage evidence trail that led to the design and final recommendation for the OCTAVE v2.0 operator set.

## The Process: From Testing to Final Design

The specification for the v2.0 operators was not arbitrary. It was the result of a deliberate, three-stage process:

1.  **Initial Multi-Model Testing:** A comprehensive test suite was executed across four major LLMs to evaluate four distinct operator styles. This testing proved that the initial Unicode (`⊕`) and ASCII Math (`+`) operators were fundamentally flawed.

2.  **Final Design Analysis:** Using the hard constraints discovered in the initial tests, a final, two-part design analysis was conducted to generate and evaluate novel, robust alternatives from first principles.

3.  **Pre-Implementation Validation Plan:** The output of the design analysis was a unanimous, multi-model consensus on a new operator family, along with a rigorous validation plan to execute before formal adoption.

## The Final Recommendation: The Square-Bracket Marks Family

All stages of analysis and testing converged on a single, optimal solution: the **Square-Bracket Marks Family**. This set was unanimously recommended by all participating models as the best possible engineering compromise, satisfying all of the project's design principles.

| Role | Recommended v2.0 Operator | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Synthesis** | **`[&]`** | The `&` glyph is a universal metaphor for "and"/"with". |
| **Tension** | **`[!]`** | The `!` glyph is a common signifier for conflict or alert. |
| **Progress** | **`[>]`** | The `>` glyph is a universally understood symbol for flow or direction. |

This family was chosen for its perfect toolchain compatibility (zero escaping needed), lack of ambiguity, and high marks for readability and LLM comprehension.

2.  **[Initial Test Runs](./01_initial_tests/)**: Contains the full, unedited outputs from the four initial model test runs that proved the original operators were flawed.

3.  **[Final Design Analysis](./02_design_analysis/)**: Documents the two-stage analysis that led to the final recommendation, including the multi-model consensus report.

4.  **[v2.0 Validation and Implementation Plan](./03_validation/v2-validation-and-implementation-plan.md)**: The final deliverable—a comprehensive plan to validate the recommended operator set before its formal adoption in OCTAVE v2.0.
