# IDE Syntax Highlighting Analysis

## Test Date: 2025-07-02

### JavaScript Syntax Highlighting (VS Code)

**Observation**: Both operator families are contained within string literals and display identically:
- Strings are highlighted in dark red/brown color
- All operators (`&`, `+`, `>`, `->`) are treated as regular string content
- No syntax highlighting interference or anomalies
- No visual distinction between operators

**Result**: ✅ **PASS** - Both families work perfectly in JavaScript strings

### Python Syntax Highlighting (VS Code)

**Observation**: Identical behavior to JavaScript:
- Strings are highlighted in dark red/brown color
- All operators are treated as regular string content
- No syntax highlighting issues
- Clean, consistent display

**Result**: ✅ **PASS** - Both families work perfectly in Python strings

### Key Findings

1. **No Syntax Conflicts**: Neither operator family causes any syntax highlighting issues in VS Code
2. **String Context**: Since operators are within string literals, they don't interact with language syntax
3. **Equal Performance**: Both families perform identically in IDE contexts

### Implications

- This test shows that both operator families are safe to use in string contexts within code
- No preference can be determined based on IDE syntax highlighting alone
- The choice between families must be based on other factors (XML compatibility, semantic clarity, etc.)

### Note

These tests only cover operators within string literals. If OCTAVE syntax were to be implemented as actual language syntax (with IDE extensions), different considerations would apply.
