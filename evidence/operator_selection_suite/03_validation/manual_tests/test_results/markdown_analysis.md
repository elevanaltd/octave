# Markdown Rendering Analysis

## Test Date: 2025-07-02

### VS Code Markdown Preview Results

#### Critical Finding: Blockquote Behavior

**Lines 8-10 show the key test** - operators within blockquotes:
- Line 8: `> DATABASE & CACHE VERSUS LATENCY > PERFORMANCE`
- Line 10: `> DATABASE + CACHE VERSUS LATENCY -> PERFORMANCE`

**Result**: Both render correctly as single-line blockquotes!
- The `>` in Family A does NOT create a nested blockquote
- The parser correctly distinguishes between the blockquote marker `>` at line start and the operator `>` within the content

#### Other Markdown Contexts

1. **Plain Text** (Lines 4-5): Both families render cleanly
2. **Code Blocks** (Lines 14-15): Perfect display for both
3. **Inline Code** (Lines 19-20): Both display correctly with syntax highlighting
4. **Lists** (Lines 23-24): Clean rendering, operators clearly visible
5. **Tables** (Lines 29-30): Both families work perfectly in table cells

### Key Observations

1. **No Markdown Conflicts**: Neither operator family causes parsing issues
2. **Blockquote Concern Resolved**: The `>` operator does NOT interfere with Markdown blockquote syntax
3. **Equal Performance**: Both families perform identically in all Markdown contexts

### Implications

- The potential concern about `>` causing blockquote conflicts was unfounded
- Markdown parsers are sophisticated enough to distinguish context
- No preference between families based on Markdown compatibility alone

### Conclusion

âœ… **PASS** for both operator families in Markdown contexts. The choice between them must be based on other factors like XML compatibility.
