# HTML and XML Compatibility Analysis

## Test Date: 2025-07-02

### HTML Rendering Results

**Browser Display**: Both operator families render correctly in HTML
- Family A (`&`): Displays properly as "&" character
- Family B (`+`): Displays properly  
- The `>` character in both families renders without issues
- HTML attributes work fine (though values aren't visible in rendered output)

**Result**: ✅ **PASS** for both families in HTML display

**Important Note**: While the HTML *displays* correctly, this doesn't mean the HTML is valid. The browser is being lenient and auto-correcting the `&` to `&amp;` internally.

### XML Results

#### Chrome Browser Display
**Critical Error**: The XML file fails to parse entirely
- Error message: "error on line 3 at column 44: xmlParseEntityRef: no name"
- The page shows a pink error box and refuses to render
- This confirms our automated testing - the `&` in Family A breaks XML parsing

#### VS Code Display
**Syntax Highlighting Shows the Problem**:
- The `&` character is highlighted differently, indicating VS Code recognizes it as problematic
- While VS Code displays the file, it's showing invalid XML
- Family B with `+` shows clean, valid XML syntax

### Key Findings

1. **Family A (`&`)**: 
   - ❌ **FAILS** XML validation completely
   - Requires escaping as `&amp;` to be valid
   - Browsers refuse to parse the XML

2. **Family B (`+`)**: 
   - ✅ **PASSES** all XML tests
   - No escaping required
   - Clean, valid XML

### Critical Implications

The XML failure is a **major toolchain compatibility issue** for Family A:
- Web services using XML would break
- Configuration files in XML format would be invalid
- SOAP APIs would fail
- Any XML-based data exchange would require constant escaping

This gives Family B a significant advantage in real-world usage.
