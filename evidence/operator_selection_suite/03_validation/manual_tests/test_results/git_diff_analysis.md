# Git Diff Analysis Results

## Test Date: 2025-07-02

### Raw Git Diff Output

```diff
diff --git a/test.txt b/test.txt
index 2a869de..251a750 100644

 # Family A
-DATABASE & CACHE VERSUS LATENCY > OLD_PERFORMANCE
+DATABASE & CACHE VERSUS LATENCY > NEW_PERFORMANCE
 
 # Family B
-DATABASE + CACHE VERSUS LATENCY -> OLD_PERFORMANCE
\ No newline at end of file
+DATABASE + CACHE VERSUS LATENCY -> NEW_PERFORMANCE
\ No newline at end of file
```

### Visual Analysis

#### Family A (& > VERSUS)
- The `>` operator is clearly visible in the diff
- No visual confusion with the diff's `>` prefix for additions
- The change from OLD to NEW is easy to spot
- Overall readability: **Good**

#### Family B (+ -> VERSUS)  
- The `+` operator could potentially be confused with diff's `+` prefix
- However, in this context it's within the line content, so distinction is clear
- The `->` operator is very clear and unambiguous
- The change from OLD to NEW is equally easy to spot
- Overall readability: **Good**

### Key Observations

1. **No Escaping Issues**: Both families display cleanly in git diff without any escaping
2. **Visual Clarity**: Both operators are distinguishable from git's diff markers
3. **Change Visibility**: The actual change (OLD_PERFORMANCE to NEW_PERFORMANCE) is equally clear in both cases

### Potential Concerns

1. **Family B's `+` operator**: In a diff showing additions (lines starting with `+`), there could be momentary confusion, but the context makes it clear
2. **Family A's `>` operator**: Similarly, in diffs showing file additions (`>`), but again context clarifies

### Conclusion

Both operator families perform well in git diff contexts. Neither shows a significant advantage over the other in terms of readability. The choice between them should be based on other factors like:
- XML/HTML compatibility (where Family B has an advantage)
- Semantic clarity
- Consistency with other tools
