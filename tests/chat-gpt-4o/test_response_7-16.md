‚úÖ Advanced Test Cases

‚∏ª

7. Complex Analysis

Diagnose a system where database locks are causing cascading failures across multiple services

Diagnosis:
    ‚Ä¢    Root Cause: Long-held row-level locks in the primary PostgreSQL instance due to uncommitted transactions from a batch processing job.
    ‚Ä¢    Observed Effects:
    ‚Ä¢    API service hangs on INSERT/UPDATE calls ‚Üí user-facing latency spikes.
    ‚Ä¢    Message queue consumers (e.g., Kafka workers) back up as DB writes fail.
    ‚Ä¢    Downstream analytics jobs delay due to missing data inserts.
    ‚Ä¢    Systemic Result: A single transactional lock starves multiple services waiting on the same table.

Remediation:
    ‚Ä¢    Enforce transaction timeouts.
    ‚Ä¢    Introduce deadlock detection and alerting.
    ‚Ä¢    Restructure writes using idempotent, retryable chunks.
    ‚Ä¢    Refactor monolithic writes into event-sourced async updates where feasible.

8. Multiple Forces

Describe a startup facing time pressure, resource constraints, and scaling challenges

Scenario:
A seed-stage startup has 6 engineers and 2 PMs. They've landed their first enterprise client, but:
    ‚Ä¢    Time Pressure: The client requires delivery of a secure admin portal within 6 weeks.
    ‚Ä¢    Resource Constraint: Backend and frontend teams are overstretched; QA is ad hoc.
    ‚Ä¢    Scaling Challenge: Usage is 10√ó projected load, exposing race conditions in session management and memory leaks in the auth layer.

Choices they face:
    ‚Ä¢    Ship fast with risk of future rollback and reputational damage.
    ‚Ä¢    Pause new features and allocate all hands to stabilization.
    ‚Ä¢    Seek external contractors, adding coordination overhead.

9. Architectural Decision

Present options for migrating from monolith to microservices with tradeoffs

Option    Description    Pros    Cons
Strangler Fig Pattern    Route traffic gradually from monolith to new services    Safe and gradual    Requires dual maintenance
Domain-Driven Split    Extract by bounded context (e.g., billing, auth, search)    Clean separation    Requires deep domain understanding
Vertical Slice Rewrite    Build new microservice for a single feature    Easy to test and isolate    Creates fragmentation if overused
Full Rewrite    Rebuild entire system as microservices    Clean slate    High cost, risk of scope creep

üß† Recommendation: Start with strangler or vertical slices, using event-driven design for decoupling.

10. Incident Response

Document a security incident from detection through resolution

Incident:
2025-07-03 @ 03:27 UTC ‚Äî Alert triggered: "Unusual OAuth token issuance from unfamiliar IP in Indonesia."

Response Timeline:
    ‚Ä¢    03:30: Incident Commander assigned. Triage begins.
    ‚Ä¢    03:35: Token identified from compromised dev laptop.
    ‚Ä¢    03:40: Manual revocation of token; audit logs preserved.
    ‚Ä¢    04:00: VPN access suspended for affected user.
    ‚Ä¢    06:00: Full rotation of all API secrets and OAuth keys.
    ‚Ä¢    08:00: Root cause: Slack phishing + reused GitHub password.

Postmortem Actions:
    ‚Ä¢    Enforce 2FA on all systems.
    ‚Ä¢    Add device-based access policies.
    ‚Ä¢    Conduct org-wide phishing simulation and training.

11. Numbers and Metrics

Report on system performance metrics including latency percentiles and error rates

Metric    P50 Latency    P95 Latency    P99 Latency    Error Rate
/api/login    110ms    420ms    900ms    0.3%
/api/search    140ms    760ms    1800ms    1.6%
/api/upload    260ms    1400ms    3200ms    4.1%

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Error rate on upload exceeds SLO. Investigate retry logic and payload size variations.

12. Boolean States

List feature flags and their current activation status

Feature Flag    Status    Description
useNewSearchAlgo    ‚úÖ Enabled    Reroutes search through vector index
betaOnboardingFlow    ‚ùå Disabled    New user flow under limited testing
darkModeAvailable    ‚úÖ Enabled    Enables UI toggle for dark mode
forceHttpsRedirect    ‚úÖ Enabled    Enforces HTTPS across all routes

13. Empty Values

Show a configuration with some undefined optional settings

deployment:
  environment: "production"
  replicas: 4
  autoscaling:
    minReplicas: 2
    maxReplicas: null  # not defined yet
  logging:
    level: "info"
    destination: null  # will default to stdout
  emailNotifications:

    smtpServer: null  # not applicable when disabled

14. Domain Assignment

Assign mythological domains to components of a modern tech stack

Tech Component    Mythological Domain    Justification
Load Balancer    Hermes (messenger of the gods)    Routes requests swiftly and intelligently
Database    Hades (underworld)    Stores deep knowledge; rarely surfaced directly
CI/CD Pipeline    Hephaestus (blacksmith)    Forges code into deployable artifacts
Monitoring Stack    Apollo (clarity and foresight)    Illuminates the health and truth of the system
Authentication Layer    Janus (Roman gatekeeper)    Controls identity and access at all thresholds


‚∏ª

15. Pattern Recognition

Identify the mythological pattern in a system that keeps requiring more resources

Pattern: Sisyphean Scaling

Like Sisyphus rolling the boulder uphill only for it to fall again, the system requires constant horizontal scaling to meet demand‚Äîbut each fix exposes a new bottleneck (e.g., DB limits, then cache miss storms, then queue backlogs).

Core Symptom: Effort applied seems to restore equilibrium temporarily, but foundational assumptions (e.g., single-region architecture, synchronous dependencies) are flawed.

‚∏ª

16. Force Dynamics

What forces are at play when a deadline approaches but quality standards must be maintained

Force    Description
Chronos (Time Pressure)    The linear march toward a deadline compresses buffers and decision cycles.
Aret√© (Excellence)    The internal or cultural imperative to maintain craft and integrity.
Bia (Force/Coercion)    Executive pressure or market commitments that push teams to cut corners.
Metis (Cunning/Pragmatism)    The adaptive intelligence required to scope ruthlessly and preserve quality where it matters most.

Tension Map:

The conflict emerges when Chronos accelerates, Bia pushes, but Aret√© resists‚Äîrequiring the invocation of Metis to find creative compromises (e.g., progressive rollout, mocking dependencies, shipping non-critical features as toggled).
