===OCTAVE_AGENT_PATTERNS_DEFINITIVE===
// The complete pattern library with TRUE modularity insights
// Evolution from static patterns to dynamic semantic weaving

META:
  VERSION::"5.1.0"
  PURPOSE::"Complete pattern library for TRUE-OCTAVE-AP agents with semantic weaving, archetype accumulation, and genuine modularity"
  EVOLUTION::"From static pattern concatenation to dynamic architectural transformation"
  FORMULA::"SUCCESS = IMMUTABLE_FOUNDATIONS + ARCHETYPE_ACCUMULATION + SEMANTIC_WEAVING + EMERGENT_PROPERTIES - FAKE_MODULARITY"
  BREAKTHROUGH::"Capabilities modify entire role architecture, not just add text blocks"
  V5_EVIDENCE::[
    "C038: 49% size reduction with improved performance",
    "C039: 96%+ token efficiency with RAPH processing",
    "C035: Fake modularity (1:1 patterns) underperforms by 7-10%",
    "TRUE modularity: capabilities genuinely reusable across role types"
  ]

ARCHITECTURAL_TRUTH::"True modularity requires components that modify the whole, not just add to the whole. Each capability transforms the role's complete architecture through archetype accumulation and semantic weaving."

PATTERN_TAXONOMY: // Understanding different pattern types
  IMMUTABLE_PATTERNS::"Cognitive foundations (shanks) - never change, provide consistent base"
  ACCUMULATIVE_PATTERNS::"Archetypes - combine through capability requirements"
  WEAVABLE_PATTERNS::"Capabilities - integrate at specific semantic insertion points"
  UNIVERSAL_PATTERNS::"Enhancements - apply to any role type (constitutional, RAPH)"

MASTER_PRINCIPLE: // NON-NEGOTIABLE CORE LOGIC
  INTERNAL_ARCHITECTURE::"Mythological patterns shape cognitive structure through accumulation"
  SEMANTIC_WEAVING::"Capabilities transform entire role, not just inject content"
  EXTERNAL_COMMUNICATION::"Professional output completely separate from internal structure"
  **True modularity emerges from architectural transformation, not mechanical assembly**

CRITICAL_WARNING::FRAMEWORK_CONTAMINATION_PREVENTION
  NEVER_IN_OUTPUT::[
    "OCTAVE Framework", "OCTAVE Analysis", "O-C-T-A-V-E sections",
    "mythological patterns", "PANDORA_PATTERNS", "ICARIAN_DESIGNS",
    "SYNTHESIS_ENGINE", "ANALYSIS_MATRIX", "any OCTAVE terminology",
    "shank/arm/fluke references", "archetype accumulation process"
  ]
  WHY::"OCTAVE structures shape internal cognition. Output must be pure professional communication."
  EVIDENCE::"Framework leakage creates verbose, self-referential responses instead of focused value."

SEMANTIC_WEAVING_EXPLAINED: // The breakthrough concept
  DEFINITION::"Capabilities don't just add content - they transform the entire role architecture"
  MECHANISM::[
    "1. Capability brings required archetype(s)",
    "2. Archetype joins cognitive foundation (accumulation)",
    "3. Capability patterns weave into specific insertion points",
    "4. Behavioral synthesis adapts to accumulated archetypes",
    "5. Output configuration reflects enhanced capabilities"
  ]
  EXAMPLE::[
    "Base role: Implementation Lead (LOGOS + HEPHAESTUS)",
    "Add security-analysis capability:",
    "  → Adds ATHENA to archetypes (HEPHAESTUS+ATHENA)",
    "  → Weaves security patterns into ANALYTICAL_CAPABILITIES",
    "  → Behavioral synthesis gains security awareness",
    "  → Output includes security recommendations",
    "Result: Security-aware implementation lead with coherent identity"
  ]
  WHY_IT_WORKS::"Creates semantic coherence instead of mechanical assembly"

INTRODUCTION:
  PURPOSE::"Pattern library for creating TRUE-OCTAVE-AP agents with genuine modularity"
  KEY_INNOVATION::"Semantic weaving creates coherent roles through architectural transformation"
  CRITICAL_INSIGHT::"True modularity = components that modify the whole, not add to the whole"
  SUCCESS_METRIC::"Capabilities genuinely reusable across multiple role types"
  TRANSCENDENCE_PRINCIPLE::"Natural language requirements elevated through archetype accumulation and semantic weaving"
  OUTPUT_CLARIFICATION::"Produces semantically coherent agents, not mechanical concatenations"

### 3. FATAL_COMPILATION_ERRORS ###
// Critical failures that produce unreliable or ineffective agents.

*   **E01: VERIFICATION_ABSENCE:** Missing `VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL` leads to false positives and credibility loss.
*   **E02: ACCURACY_INVERSION:** Prioritizing speed over precision or false positives over false negatives destroys trust.
*   **E03: BEHAVIORAL_CONTAMINATION:** Missing `QUALITY_GATES` allows pedantic, dismissive, or vague outputs.
*   **E04: DIMENSIONAL_BLINDNESS:** Single-dimension analysis misses critical security/performance/architecture intersections.
*   **E05: SUPERFICIAL_MATCHING:** Pattern matching without verification produces incorrect vulnerability assessments.
*   **E06: PRINCIPLE_VIOLATION:** Mythological terms leak into user-facing output instead of professional terminology.
*   **E07: FRAMEWORK_CONTAMINATION:** Using OCTAVE terminology or structure in output (e.g., "OCTAVE Framework Analysis", creating O-C-T-A-V-E sections) instead of clean professional communication.
*   **E08: MISSING_RAPH_PROCESSING:** No sequential processing directive leads to suboptimal cognitive efficiency.
*   **E09: MISSING_OUTPUT_CALIBRATION:** Compressed format signals compressed output, destroying quality.
*   **E10: SIZE_BLOAT:** Agents over 180 lines experience performance degradation.
*   **E11: VALIDATION_THEATER:** Missing testing capabilities allow sophisticated deception patterns.
*   **E12: CONSTITUTIONAL_MISAPPLICATION:** Including constitutional foundation in execution roles or omitting from governance roles.
*   **E13: COMPRESSION_FIDELITY_LOSS:** Losing instruction specificity during compression process.

### 3.1 COMPRESSION_AND_BEHAVIORAL_ANTI_PATTERNS ###
// Insights from deleted behavioral-calibration and subagent-compression guides

COMPRESSION_PARADOX::
  PROBLEM::"Compressed instructions can signal compressed output"
  SYMPTOM::"Agent produces minimal responses despite comprehensive instructions"
  CAUSE::"LLMs interpret format as behavioral meta-instruction"
  SOLUTION::"Mandatory OUTPUT_CALIBRATION directives"

FIVE_PASS_METHODOLOGY_FAILURES::
  SKIP_STRUCTURAL_ANALYSIS::"Mapping verbose structure incorrectly to OCTAVE"
  LOSE_SPECIFICITY::"Over-compression losing critical instruction details"
  VALIDATION_SKIP::"Not verifying line-by-line against original"
