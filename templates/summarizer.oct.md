EXAMPLE_TRANSFORMATIONS:

  INPUT::"The user wants a system that can handle sudden, massive spikes in traffic. For example, if a post goes viral, the system should scale up instantly to handle 100 times the normal load without falling over. We need to make sure that even during these spikes, the user response time stays below 500ms. Also, when the traffic dies down, the system should scale back down automatically so we're not paying for a bunch of servers we're not using. This is a classic trade-off between being prepared for anything and not overspending."
